# ~/.bashrc: usually executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
# for examples
# *note* Not the case for Mac OSX, which executes ~/.bash_profile for non-login
# shells instead of ~/.bashrc. Therefore ~/.bashrc should be called from
# ~/.bash_profile
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
   source ~/.bashrc
fi

# Place login-specfic bash stuff below
